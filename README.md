This project examines the impact of day-of-the-week effects on epidemic trend inference. By analyzing these patterns, we aim to improve the precision of epidemic inferring and better understand how reporting or behavioral changes across different days influence model inference. For a detailed overview, refer to the included poster file.

This research was conducted as part of the Vacation Program at the University of Melbourne, under the supervision of Dr. Oliver Eales and A/Prof. Freya Shearer. The training model, ps_single_final.stan, was provided by my supervisors.
